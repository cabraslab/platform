# Contributing to CabrasLab

We are excited that you're interested in contributing to **CabrasLab**!
Contributions come in many forms, from reporting issues, submitting bug fixes, suggesting features, to improving our documentation.
We value every contribution and look forward to collaborating with you.

## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, an error, or something that can be improved, we encourage you to [open an issue](https://github.com/cabraslab/issues) on the relevant repository.

- Search for existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- When opening a new issue, provide as much detail as possible (operating system, steps to reproduce, screenshots, etc.).
- Specify whether it is a bug, feature request, or a general question.

### 2. Suggesting Features

We love feature suggestions!
If you have an idea that you think would improve the project:
- Open a feature request via the issue tracker.
- Clearly describe the proposed feature and its benefits.
- Outline possible technical details, challenges, or constraints.

### 3. Submitting Code Changes

We use pull requests (PRs) for code contributions.
Hereâ€™s how you can make a contribution:

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix and commit your changes.

   - Ensure that your code is clean, readable, and follows the project's coding guidelines.
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
   
4. **Write Tests**: If your change affects functionality, include tests that cover your changes.
   
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and open a new pull request (PR) from your fork.

   - Reference any related issue numbers (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Describe the changes you made and why they are necessary.
   - Ensure that the PR adheres to the template provided (if applicable).

### 4. Code Review Process

- After submitting a pull request, it will be reviewed by a maintainer.
- If there are changes requested, please update your PR accordingly and respond to comments.
- Ensure your pull request passes any automated checks (tests, linting, etc.).
- Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.

### 5. Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are highly appreciated!
If you find missing, unclear, or outdated documentation:
- Submit a PR with your suggested changes.
- Make sure the documentation aligns with the current state of the project.
